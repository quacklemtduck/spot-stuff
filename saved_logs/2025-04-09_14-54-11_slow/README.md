# Run 2025-04-09_14-54-11

This was the first run to move the arm and stand on its own.

Used commit [f350e88](https://github.com/quacklemtduck/spot-stuff/commit/f350e884d3d10e4d0e122d5d601f0c0da4787e49)

## Notes

- Started moving the arm after about 8000 iterations.
- Biggest improvement was adding rewards and penalties for surviving or terminating
- Only used a curriculum on action_rate, joint_vel and orientation_tracking
