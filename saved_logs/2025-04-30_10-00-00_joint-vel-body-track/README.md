# Run 2025-04-30_10-00-00

In this run we gave a bigger penalty for arm velocity in the hopes it would slow down the movements and make them more predictable.
We also adde body tracking.
The difference between having just velocity penalty and adding body tracking can be seen. Adding the body tracking made it more stable. None of them were able to finish the benchmark as they failed on the ones on the sides, but the body tracking one did significantly better and ended up less disorientated than the other one.
