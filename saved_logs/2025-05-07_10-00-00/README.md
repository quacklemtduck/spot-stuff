# Experiment 2025-05-07_10-00-00

This version tracks the body in the observation. It has no penalty for rotating the body, but has a penalty for moving (good boy points).
This was in the hopes that it would be able to correct itself if the body rotated
It also uses the more exploratory config file.

## Notes

It is able to reach positions all around the body, but after a while it rotates the body and does not correct itself.
